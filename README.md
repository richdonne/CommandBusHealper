=================

Based on Lasracasts Command handler, this is to help create Classes

Import these files to your laravel installation

then php artisan should list comm:make

------------

comm:make -h   : help file

Syntax

comm:make  {commandname} {folder} {table}

{commandname} : this is the name of the command you want to create, do not put Command on the end

{folder} this is the folder name you wish to create or store the commands in

{table} this is the name of the Database table you with to use


---------------

I have no idea how to make this into a package.

Good Luck.
